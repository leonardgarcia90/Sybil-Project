# Integration of Imaging Features and Clinical Features for Early Detection of Lung Cancer


This project includes two files: 'Sybil_Project.ipynb' and 'Sybil ML Training.ipynb.' Sybil_Project provides functions to extract metadata from dicom files, prepare data for use in Sybil, run Sybil on data, and to use Sybil to perform image feature extraction. Sybil ML Training provides functions to pre-process data for use in machine learning models and functions to compare performance between models.
